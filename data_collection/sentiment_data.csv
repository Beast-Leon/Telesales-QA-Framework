as a result of that insurance company actually formulated a very special thirtieth anniversay insurance bundle right called the i thirty,0
i dont want to talk with you,-1

miss seah what so special about I thirty is that for a flat premium right you can actually cover yourself against accidents twenty one cover infection,0
if you don’t mind me asking have you bought a enhanced fire package for your home yet,1
okay your home is hdb or private,0
if fully paid you must have some form of coverage because okay this is informative okay no obligation whatsoever glad to share information,0
once they pay okay you are not really required to buy any fire insurance just to let you know okay,0
okay very dangerous a lot of people actually go on and buy the enhanced home package because number one the basic plan will only cover your four walls,0
but under our plan this will cover you up to one hundred and fifty thousand for your building and renovation okay and then also fifty thousand for your content,0
content you know everything inside your home like your tv your sofa set your valuable your gucci bag your laptop all these all included okay,0
then most important is the reason main reason why people switch from basic to enhance right you because of the third party liability okay ,0
now third party liability means touch wood in case of a fire happening in a home right is spread to your neighbours correct your left or right your top your bottom,0
so they will definitely sue you for the damages so in order not to pay for their damages for the rest of our lives right we will cover you up to a million dollars,0
I will definitely send you a brouchure then call the email just let you know there are two types of coverage the other coverage this one is the individual I quoted is thirty one dollars per month,0
it can protect yourself and your baby right all the way until the age of eight then I believe this the only accident plan whereby the premium doint increase with each year,0
as long as children below twenty five years old its still dependend children which means youre not working full time right,0
usually financially dependent on parents right so ya this is a plan with only one dollar sixty cents we cover full family member so if lets say for four person one person parment one day is about forty cents,0
may I put you on hold while I check with my supervisor on your enquiry,1
thank you for holding the line,1
may I proceed to help you with the purchase now,1
has anyone from us or a broker quoted you,1
mr Ang this is how the protection works for you,1
